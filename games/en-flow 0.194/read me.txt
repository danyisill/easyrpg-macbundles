.Introduction

Production tool: RPG Maker 2000

This is a derivative game of Yume Nikki, made for a 'Create a Yume Nikki-like game' thread. It has absolutely no connection with Yume Nikki itself.

Still, I took inspiration from things other than Yume Nikki (such as iron pipes), but there is no connection to them, either.

Also, please take warning that the game contains grotesque content.

I would appreciate being contacted if there are bugs. I am desperate to squash them all, and other things I'm displeased with.



.How to play

Before starting the game:

Problems may occur if you do not extract the game from the .rar.

Once the files have been extracted, copy the RPG_RT.exe from somewhere else and place it in the folder. (This is to save file size.) After that, start the game as usual.

* (Translator's note: You do not need to do this nowadays. Simply run flow.exe in Japanese locale.)

After starting:

Confirm: Z or Enter keys
Cancel: X or Esc keys
Move: Arrow keys

Rather than the desk, you enter the 'dream' via the desk.
You can save in the bed.
The wall to the right of the door is the debug room.

* (Translator's note: The debug room is no longer accessible without glitching or modding.)

Pinch yourself awake via the 'Special' menu sceen.
Press the Shift key to use effects.
This will be smoother if the Shift key's shortcut is turned off.

(Control panel -> accessibility options -> fixed key settings -> turn off shortcut key use)

I think it should be okay to turn off, since the fixed key function is rarely used.






Walk around the rusted world.
